# VMware.View.Broker
Powershell module for manipulating VMware Horizon View Connection Server

VMware PowerCLI provides module VMware.VimAutomation.HorizonView to connect with View connection server. Sample usage of VMware.VimAutomation.HorizonView could be found at https://code.vmware.com/apis/58/view .

Compared to origin VMware View PowerCLI (available as a Powershell snapin), this new module is not very easy to use. So I created this VMware.View.Broker module to provide easy-to-use functions.
